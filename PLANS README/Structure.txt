Desired architecture::

Tiles
 - Have a population (even non-town Tiles)
 - May have a town (needs a pointer!)
 - Need a function which returns 
 	how much of the population belongs to each religion (don't need to be strict, overlap is ok)
 - thus, needs a structure to know either ratio or absolute which pop belongs to which religion
 
Religion
 - ReligionManager needs to ask TileManager for all tiles, and update the Followers of each Religion (on Tick)
